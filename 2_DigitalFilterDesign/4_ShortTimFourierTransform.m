%% |chirp| function
% The |chirp| function generates samples of a linear swept-frequency
% cosine signal. The |chirp| function is used to simulate a radar pulse.
% The |chirp| function is defined as follows:
%
% $$x(t) = \cos(2\pi f_0 t + \pi \beta t^2 + \phi_0)$$
%
% where
%
% * $f_0$ is the instantaneous frequency at time $t=0$.
% * $\beta$ is the rate of change of the instantaneous frequency.
% * $\phi_0$ is the initial phase of the signal.
%
% We can also define the chirp signal as a function of frequency:
%
% $$x(t) = \cos(\Phi(t))$$
%
% where
% $f(t) = f_0 + \beta t$ is the instantaneous frequency at time $t$.
%
% and
%
% $\Phi(t) = \Phi_0 + 2\pi \int_0^t f(\tau) d\tau$ is the instantaneous phase at time $t$.
%
% where
%
% * $f(t) = f_0 + \beta t$ is the instantaneous frequency at time $t$.
% * $\beta = \frac{f_1 - f_0}{T}$ is the rate of change of the instantaneous frequency.
% * $\phi_0$ is the initial phase of the signal.
% * $f_0$ is the initial frequency of the signal.
% * $f_1$ is the final frequency of the signal.
% * $T$ is the duration of reaching from $f_0$ to $f_1$.
%
% To implement the chirp signal, we use the |chirp| function. The |chirp|
% function is defined as follows:
%
% |y = chirp(t,f_0,t_1,f_1)|
%
% where
%
% * $t$ is the time vector.
% * $f_0$ is the initial frequency of the signal.
% * $f_1$ is the final frequency of the signal.
% * $t_1$ is the time for reaching the final frequency.

%% Short-time Fourier Transform
% The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is a Fourier-related transform
% used to determine the sinusoidal frequency and phase content of local
% sections of a signal as it changes over time. In practice, the procedure
% for computing STFTs is to divide a longer time signal into shorter
% segments of equal length and then compute the Fourier transform
% separately on each shorter segment. This reveals the Fourier spectrum on
% each shorter segment. One then usually plots the changing spectra as a
% function of time, as this will reveal frequency content that is varying
% with time. The STFT is used in many areas of engineering, especially for
% analyzing signals that change over time. It is a type of time-frequency
% analysis.
%
% The STFT of a discrete-time signal $x[n]$ is defined as follows:
%
% $$X[m,k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] w[n-m] e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}kn}$$
%
% where
%
% * $x[n]$ is the discrete-time signal.
% * $w[n]$ is the window function.
% * $N$ is the length of the window.
% * $m$ is the index of the window.
% * $k$ is the index of the frequency.
%
% The STFT of a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ is defined as follows:
%
% $$X(m,\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) w(t-mT) e^{-j\omega t} dt$$
%
% where
%
% * $x(t)$ is the continuous-time signal.
% * $w(t)$ is the window function.
% * $T$ is the sampling period.
% * $m$ is the index of the window.
% * $\omega$ is the frequency.
%
% * Note:* The STFT is a Fourier-related transform, not a Fourier transform.
%
%% |stft| function
% The |stft| function computes the STFT of a discrete-time signal. The
% |stft| function is defined as follows:

%
% where
%
% * $x$ is the discrete-time signal.
% * $fs$ is the sampling frequency.
% * $Window$ is the window function.
% * $OverlapLength$ is the overlap length.
% * $FFTLength$ is the FFT length.
% * $FrequencyRange$ is the frequency range.
% * $s$ is the STFT of the signal.
% * $t$ is the time vector.
% * $f$ is the frequency vector.
%
